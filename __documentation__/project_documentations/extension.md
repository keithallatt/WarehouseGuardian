# Extension:

If you want to extend our project, it is not very difficult to do so.

All our prefabs are editable, meaning you can add extra features via new scripts and/or animations.

A simple extension is to be able to add new levels. An easy way of doing this is to use the assets for tiles and walls to design a new level. After this, box collision detectors can be added to the walls, and enemies and boxes and box endpoints. Testing these levels is as easy as moving the player object to your level and hitting the play button in Unity.
