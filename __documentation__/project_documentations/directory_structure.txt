Directory Structure:

Most directories in our project are a result of our choice of development environment. Unity stores its files, assets and meta-data in a directory structure very similar to that of our project. The non-Unity files are the '__documentation__' folder, which contains screen shots and small bits of documentation not suited for a README.md document. 

The README.md and LICENSE.md files detail our project for potential contributors and users. They detail how to play and use the software, and to what extent the software can be reused. 

The Assets folder contains all assets we use for our game. This includes our Prefabs (prefabricated asset) and our Scenes (what is shown on screen). 

The rest of the folders contain mostly meta-data for our game. Most is not necessary, as Unity will autogenerate some of it, but other pieces are crucial.
